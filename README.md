# DS4CO2.2FinalProj
Final Project for Data Science 4

To start, we can go to the link below:

Make a copy in our Google Drive, and start from there.
We have only uploaded a python file as opposed to a proper ipynb due to the limits in GitHub allowing only a maximum of 25MB per file upload, our .ipynb was 36.7MB.

To formally start, we will of course run the cells up to the one where it prompts us to mount our Google Drive.
When we see the part where it wants us to mount our Google Drive, we shall download the .tfevents generated by the code, as well as the .pth we would want to use.

For our case, we used the best EMA one as this is what we consider to be most stable.

After that, we can continually run the cells until the very end as there will no longer be any prompts required to be interacted with by the user.

As for the ones who would prefer to choose another dataset, they may modify the class numbers, class names, as well as the import at the start of the notebook.
